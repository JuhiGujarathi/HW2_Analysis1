hw2_juhi_gujarathi_aap
==============================

Homework 2: Doing Excel work with Python

1. I have created whatif folder by name hw2_juhi_gujarathi_aap with same filename which includes all the functions used in the Analysis.

2. Analysis1_Basic_Break_Even_Analysis.ipynb is the file where I have written the code for Anaysis1: Basic break even Analysis.

3. This file is stored in scr/hw2_juhi_gujarathi_aap folder.
